# Pokémon World App

This App contains a Pokédex page (500 Pokémon with their stats) and a Pokémon Quiz page.

## How the App was built

This Application was originally a CareerFoundry project built to create a Pokédex App. While making the App I experimented with writing the code in vanilla **javaScript** and then **jQuery**.  It makes calls from an [external API](https://pokeapi.co/) to first load the data on an array of buttons, followed by an Event Listener to open up the stats in a modal.  At first I built these components manually with vanilla javaScript, but then used **Bootstrap** to practice using this library.

After I completed the CareerFoundry course I wanted to expand the App.  I decided to make a new landing page and had fun with the CSS - the pokemon spins on hover :) I also made a quiz page in javaScript to practice DOM manipulation.

..I have more ideas for further interactive pages in the future (mini-games).
